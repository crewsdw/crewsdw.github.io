### Benvenuto!

Welcome to the research site of Daniel W. Crews!

I'm a research scientist at Zap Energy, Inc. and a recent PhD graduate from the University of Washington's Computational Plasma Dynamics laboratory.

The purpose of this site is primarily to share my research notes and academic publications with anyone who may be interested.
You can find the works separated into appropriate sections under the "Research" tab above.
Happy exploring!
